# Outdoor-camps-
Project-Outdoor:
Just like trivago displays hotel sites and allows users to login, rate the hotels , review the hotels and comment on the hotels, I have created a same project for camping sites ( alias campgrounds) by the name of Outdoor,

Built with,
Front End:
1) Ejs
2) Html
3) Css
4) Bootstrap

Back end:
1) Express
2) mongoDB
3) mongoose
4) async
5) crypto
6) passport
7) passport-local
8) express-session
9) method-override
10) nodemailer
11) moment
12) geocoder
13) connect-flash


I have included the following features:
1) User login
2) Admin login
3) Logout
4) Sign up
5) Flash messages for logout and create comments and reviews and create campgrounds
6) The user creating the campground will only be able to see the edit and delete button if he is logged in , same for comments and reviews, only the user creating it can see the edit and delete buttons and work with it ,
7) Each campground displays all the information about the user who created it in the form of a link, i.e user profile, as well the real date and time at which it was created
8) Each comment and review also displays about who created it and when it was created
9) There is also a forgot password functionality which sends the user a link to reset a password
10) Admin can update , edit or delete any campground,comment etc , for admin login, a code has to be entered in the admin code field at the time of user creation which is “secretcode123”which makes user an admin
11) There is also a search bar which allows us to search for any campgrounds within the application and returns it
12) Features for making a comment and submitting a review on the campgrounds have been included.




Features which I will include soon are:
1) In App Notifications
2) Pagination on campgrounds index
3) Image upload using cloudinary
4) Location display using g maps
